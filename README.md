# holiday-site

![screenshot](demo.jpg)

This is a demo-site using the [@jbouduin/holiday-lib](https://github.com/jbouduin/holiday) npm-package.
The site itself is implemented very rudimentary and there is plenty of room for improvement.

You can see the site [here](https://jbouduin.github.io/holiday-site/)
